Questions
•	Findings from your charters. Did everything work as expected? What bugs were discovered?
Everything worked as expected but I found a find when I enter the balance and I do not see the subtraction there from the total value.

•	Prioritization of those charters - which area of the app or testing would you explore first and why? How much time have you planned to spend for each charter?
The first test will be the balance, because if this fails the application would have a very high reputational risk
I planned 30 minutes for each charter

•	What kind of risks do you need to mitigate for this type of application?

Number	Type of Risk	Summary	Mitigation Plan
1	Technical	the subtraction of the income with the expenses is bad	test with expensives and income
2	Technical	Create a registration without value	Test to check
